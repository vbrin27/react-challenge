# React App Challenge

There are 2 parts to this challnge: 
1. In the **challenges** directory you'll find a few snippets of JavaScript and React code. Read the question carefully and code your answer as described in the challenge
2. The **project** directory is going to be a real world challenge of creating a reach app using the deliverables and instructions listed in the directory's README

This repository should be forked before you start the challenges and then should completed on a seperate branch of your own fork. Then make a PR to the main branch so that it can be reviewed.

### Good Luck!
